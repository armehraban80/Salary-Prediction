# Salary-Prediction
The goal is to predict the salary of data related positions based on location, company review and job title
I will implement the model based on CRISP methodology.

I use the following models for prediction:

Model #1: lienar regression to predcit the target (average salary)
Model #2: Logistic Regression to predicct average salary is more than median or not: 1, 0 (classification)
